Responsive Layout Module 2 Coursera Johns Hopkins -------> https://jean-joooo.github.io/module2-solution/

In this exercise, I focused on creating a responsive layout without using any CSS frameworks, including Twitter Bootstrap. The task involved implementing breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. A simple site structure with a page heading and three sections was designed to adapt based on the browser window's width.

Key Objectives
Implement breakpoints for desktop (992px and above), tablet (768px to 991px), and mobile (767px and below) views.
Create a simple site with a page heading and three sections, each with a section title region.
Achieve a specific layout for each view, adjusting section sizes and positioning based on the viewport width.
Pay attention to spacing, borders, and colors as per the provided mockup illustrations.

Implementation
Utilized media queries for different breakpoints, controlling the layout based on viewport width.
Used percentages and float property for equal section distribution in desktop view.
Positioned sections in rows for tablet and mobile views.
Employed relative and absolute positioning for section title regions.
Ensured proper spacing, borders, and colors according to mockup requirements.

This exercise honed my skills in responsive web design without relying on CSS frameworks. By implementing custom breakpoints and adhering to spacing and styling specifications, the exercise showcased the ability to create visually appealing layouts across various device views.
